  - Multiple output formats: human, JSON, GitHub Actions, compact
  - Summary statistics with added/modified/deleted counts and timing

### Added - v1.1.0 Observability & Reliability

  - State transition logging with observability integration
- **Enhanced Error Context**
  - Request ID tracking throughout pipeline execution
  - Duration tracking for all operations
  - Structured error messages with contextual information
- **Queue Compaction Configuration**
  - Configurable thresholds with adaptive defaults
  - Formula: `min(1000, maxSecretsPerMount/100)`
  - YAML configuration support
- **Race Condition Prevention**
  - Proper mutex protection for concurrent map access
  - All tests pass with `-race` detector
- **Docker Image Version Pinning**
  - All test images pinned to specific versions for reproducible builds

### Added - v1.0 Core Features
- **SecretSync 1.0 Release** - Complete rebranding and architecture overhaul
- Recursive Vault KV2 listing with BFS traversal
- Target inheritance with circular dependency detection
- Deepmerge support (list append, dict merge, scalar override)
- AWS Organizations dynamic account discovery
- Fuzzy name matching for AWS accounts
- S3 merge store support
- TTL-based caching for AWS ListSecrets
- Enhanced path validation (directory traversal, null byte injection protection)
- LogicalClient interface for testability
- Comprehensive test suite (150+ test functions)

### Changed
- **PROJECT RENAME**: vault-secret-sync → SecretSync
- CLI renamed from `vss` to `secretsync`
- Docker images published to `docker.io/jbcom/secretsync`
- Helm charts published to `oci://registry-1.docker.io/jbcom/secretsync`
- Simplified pipeline architecture (removed legacy operator complexity)
- Environment variable prefix changed from `VSS_` to `SECRETSYNC_`

### Removed
- Legacy Kubernetes operator architecture (~13k lines)
- Backend packages (kube, file)
- Queue packages (redis, nats, sqs, memory)
- Notification packages (webhook, slack, email)
- GCP/GitHub/Doppler/HTTP store implementations
- Event processing system

### Security
- Race condition fixes in AWS client with mutex protection
- Cache invalidation on writes to prevent stale data
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Type-safe Vault API response parsing
- Safe type assertions throughout codebase
- Intelligent value masking in diff output to prevent credential exposure

### Fixed
- Cache invalidation after WriteSecret and DeleteSecret operations
- Structured logging consistency
- Error context in vault traversal with depth and count info
- Critical lint errors (copylocks, staticcheck QF1003)
- Integration test coverage in CI/CD pipeline

### Fork Rationale

This project is a complete rebranding and reimplementation of vault-secret-sync,
focused on providing a streamlined, pipeline-based secret synchronization tool.

**Key differences from upstream:**
- Pipeline-driven architecture instead of Kubernetes operator
- Support for dynamic AWS Organizations discovery
- Enhanced merge strategies matching Python's deepmerge
- Simplified configuration and deployment
- GitHub Marketplace Action support
