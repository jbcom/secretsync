# Privacy Policy for SecretSync

**Effective Date:** December 8, 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 8, 2024

## Introduction

SecretSync is a free, open-source GitHub Action for secrets synchronization. This privacy policy describes what data SecretSync collects and how it's used.

## Data Collection

### Data We DO NOT Collect

SecretSync **does not collect, store, or transmit** any user data to external servers. Specifically:

- ❌ No secret values or credentials are collected
- ❌ No configuration data is sent to third parties
- ❌ No telemetry or analytics are collected
- ❌ No usage statistics are tracked
- ❌ No personal information is gathered
- ❌ No logs are sent to external services

### How SecretSync Works

SecretSync runs entirely within your GitHub Actions workflow environment:

1. **Execution**: Runs in a Docker container within GitHub's infrastructure
2. **Configuration**: Reads configuration from your repository files
3. **Authentication**: Uses credentials you provide via GitHub Secrets or OIDC
4. **Operations**: Connects directly to your Vault, AWS, GCP, or other services
5. **Logging**: All logs remain within GitHub Actions log system

## Third-Party Services

SecretSync connects to services **you configure**, which may include:

- **HashiCorp Vault**: Your own Vault instance
- **AWS Services**: Your AWS accounts (Secrets Manager, S3, Organizations, etc.)
- **GCP Services**: Your GCP projects (Secret Manager)
- **Other Secret Stores**: Any services you configure in your config file

Each of these services has its own privacy policy and data handling practices. SecretSync acts as a client to these services on your behalf.
