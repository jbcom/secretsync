## Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Final Testing

Before publishing, test the action:

```bash
# 1. Validate entrypoint script
sh -n entrypoint.sh

# 2. Test Docker build (if environment allows)
docker build -t secretsync-test .

# 3. Create a test workflow in .github/workflows/test-action.yml
# Example test workflow:
```

```yaml
name: Test Action
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_OIDC_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      
      - name: Test Action
        uses: ./
        with:
          config: examples/action-test-config.yaml
          dry-run: 'true'
        env:
          VAULT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
```

### Step 2: Create Version Tag

```bash
# 1. Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# 2. Create annotated tag for first release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - Initial GitHub Marketplace release"

# 3. Push tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0

# 4. Create major version tag (for users)
git tag -fa v1 -m "Release v1 - Initial release"
git push origin v1 --force
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to: https://github.com/jbcom/secretsync/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Release title: `v1.0.0 - GitHub Marketplace Release`
5. Release description:

```markdown
