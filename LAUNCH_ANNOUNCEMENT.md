# 🚀 Announcing SecretSync v1.2.0 - Enterprise-Grade Secret Synchronization

We're excited to announce the public release of **SecretSync v1.2.0**, an enterprise-grade secret synchronization pipeline that transforms how organizations manage secrets across HashiCorp Vault and AWS Secrets Manager.

## 🎯 What is SecretSync?

SecretSync provides **fully automated, enterprise-grade secret synchronization** with a unique **two-phase pipeline architecture** (merge → sync) that supports inheritance, dynamic target discovery, and CI/CD-friendly diff reporting.

**Perfect for:** Multi-account AWS environments, Kubernetes deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and enterprise secret management at scale.

## 🤔 Why SecretSync?

| Feature | SecretSync | Alternatives |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Two-Phase Pipeline** | ✅ Merge → Sync with inheritance | ❌ Simple 1:1 sync only |
| **AWS Organizations** | ✅ Dynamic discovery with tag filtering | ❌ Manual account management |
| **Secret Versioning** | ✅ Complete audit trail with rollback | ❌ No version tracking |
| **Enhanced Diff** | ✅ Side-by-side with intelligent masking | ❌ Basic text diff |
| **Enterprise Scale** | ✅ 1000+ accounts, circuit breakers | ❌ Limited scalability |
| **CI/CD Integration** | ✅ GitHub Action + exit codes | ❌ Manual scripting required |

## ✨ Key Features in v1.2.0

### 🔍 Enhanced AWS Organizations Discovery
- **Advanced Tag Filtering**: Multiple tag filters with wildcard support (`Environment=prod*`, `Team=platform-?`)
- **Flexible Logic**: Configure AND/OR combinations for complex filtering scenarios
- **OU-Based Discovery**: Target specific organizational units with nested traversal
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically exclude suspended and closed accounts
- **Performance Caching**: In-memory cache with 1-hour TTL for faster subsequent discoveries

### 🔐 AWS Identity Center Integration
- **Permission Set Discovery**: Automatic mapping of permission sets to readable names
- **Account Assignments**: Track which users/groups have access to which accounts
- **Cross-Region Support**: Automatically discover Identity Center instances across regions
- **Assignment Caching**: 30-minute TTL for assignment data to optimize performance

### 📚 Secret Versioning System
- **Version Tracking**: Every secret change tracked with metadata
- **S3-Based Storage**: Reliable, scalable version history storage
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable cleanup of old versions
- **Version Rollback**: CLI support for rolling back to specific versions
- **Diff Integration**: See version transitions in diff output (v1 → v2)

### 🎨 Enhanced Diff Output
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Visual comparison with aligned columns and color coding
- **Intelligent Masking**: Automatically detect and mask sensitive values (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Multiple Formats**: Human-readable, JSON, GitHub Actions annotations, compact
- **Rich Statistics**: Detailed counts of changes, size differences, and execution timing

### 🛡️ Enterprise Reliability (v1.1.0)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic failure detection and recovery for Vault and AWS
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Production-ready observability with `/metrics` endpoint
- **Enhanced Error Context**: Request ID tracking and structured error messages
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Thread-safe operations with comprehensive testing

Title: [Open Source] SecretSync v1.2.0 - Enterprise-grade secret sync from Vault to AWS Secrets Manager

Hey r/devops! 

I'm excited to share SecretSync v1.2.0, an open-source secret synchronization pipeline I've been working on. It's designed specifically for enterprise environments that need to sync secrets from HashiCorp Vault to AWS Secrets Manager at scale.

**What makes it different:**
- **Two-phase architecture**: Merge secrets from multiple sources, then sync to targets with inheritance
- **AWS Organizations integration**: Automatically discover accounts with tag filtering and wildcards
- **Secret versioning**: Complete audit trail with rollback capability
- **Enhanced diff**: Side-by-side comparison with intelligent masking of sensitive values
- **Production ready**: 150+ tests, circuit breakers, Prometheus metrics

**Perfect for:**
- Multi-account AWS environments (we handle 1000+ accounts)
- Kubernetes deployments with complex secret hierarchies
- CI/CD pipelines (includes native GitHub Action)
- Organizations migrating from Vault to AWS Secrets Manager

**Quick example:**
```yaml
discovery:
  aws_organizations:
    tag_filters:
      - key: "Environment"
        values: ["prod*", "staging"]
        operator: "contains"
    cache_ttl: "1h"

versioning:
  enabled: true
  s3_bucket: "my-secretsync-versions"
  retention_days: 90
```

The project originated as a fork of vault-secret-sync but has evolved into something much more comprehensive. It's MIT licensed and ready for production use.
