# Active Context

## Project Overview

SecretSync is a production-ready Go application for syncing secrets from HashiCorp Vault to AWS Secrets Manager and other external secret stores. It uses a pipeline-based architecture with configuration inheritance via S3 merge stores.

### Key Features
- Vault KV2 recursive secret listing
- Deep merge strategy for configuration
- Target inheritance model via S3
- AWS Organizations discovery
- Pipeline-based sync (merge + sync phases)
- GitHub Action and CLI

### Current Status
- **Version:** Working toward v1.1.0
- **Go Version:** 1.25.3+
- **Test Coverage:** 113+ test functions
- **Architecture:** Simplified from Kubernetes operator to focused CLI tool

## Active Development

**In Progress (PRs #64-71):**
- #69, #46: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- #70, #47: Circuit breaker pattern for API resilience
- #71, #48: Enhanced error messages with request IDs

## Architecture

### Package Structure
```
pkg/
├── client/          # External service clients
│   ├── vault/       # Vault KV2 client with recursive listing
│   └── aws/         # AWS services (Secrets Manager, S3, Organizations)
├── pipeline/        # Core pipeline logic (merge + sync)
├── diff/            # Secret difference computation
├── discovery/       # AWS resource discovery
└── utils/           # Shared utilities (deepmerge, etc.)
```

### Key Patterns
- **Dependency Injection:** Interfaces for testability
- **Context Propagation:** All I/O operations accept `context.Context`
- **Error Wrapping:** Structured errors with `fmt.Errorf(...: %w, err)`
- **Table-Driven Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage
